# 0X1B - SORTING ALGORITHMS  
## BIG O NOTATION
Big O notation is simply the **relative** **representation** of the time **complexity** of an algorithm. Relative in this context means we are comparing two algorithms that perform the same action. Representation means that the value is not the actual value but is an approximate value. Complexity means a relative measure to something else. In simple terms, it is how well the algorithm works with large inputs.
